# Payleak.io
Payleak.io was a project dedicated to open-sourcing and crowd sourcing salary information based on location.

## Why use payleak instead of job search sites?
Two key observations led to the creation of payleak: 
 - What wage you ended up with had many more variable than just work experience
 - Salary negotiations were unfairly asymmetrical
 
For example, a lifeguard working one block over could have been paid $2 more because of market demands. Such subtle differences are near impossible to uncover using traditional job search sites.
In addition, in salary negotiations (particularly in lower wage jobs with little data), employers inherently have asymmetrical information advantage. They know what other firms are paying, they know what their overhead is, etc.

In this case, knowing the "median" wage isn't important. What's important is the precedent wage + local information.

## Why did this fail?
I think our premise was sound, however, we couldn't solve the "chicken and egg" problem of most social/crowd sourcing websites. We tried to mitigate this with a chat room for each location (each McDonald's stores for example) in an attempt to replicate facebook's early strategy.

The uploaded code is deprecated, insecure, and was only used for fast prototyping (< 2 or so days).
